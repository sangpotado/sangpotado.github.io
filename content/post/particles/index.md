I like `brainxyz` youtube channel a lot. He uses Computer Science as a tool to study consciousness, intelligence, the universe, etc... Which is also my approach, but he's on a different level. 

Here's the video that inspires this project: [Create Artificial Life From Simple Rules - Particle Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kx4Y9TVMGg&t=396s)

For my project, I kinda applied OOP principle, because I'm gonna make more simulations based on this work. `p5js` makes the code much slower, but well, the further work will make it worth it. This is also a good refresh on HTML and CSS.

Have fun!
